#Privacy Policy

This program is a client-application, meaning it merely acts as an interface that facilitates interaction/communication of data between you, the user and your chosen service provider for communication, so please be sure to read the privacy policy of your chosen service provider, in the case of sip2sip their privacy-friendly policy can be read here:
http://sip2sip.info/privacy/

The app, acting as an interface between you and your chosen communication service provider, in consequence has a simple privacy policy:
the account information provided is used to access and use your chosen SIP (or other kind of) communication service, the service access information is stored locally on your computer while the app is installed,
it is not used or accessed by any other apps or third parties (aside of course from the service you use for communicating). 
 
Media information (potential audio/video recordings, call logs, text messages) are stored locally by the app on your computer while the app is installed (deleted after) and when sent over the internet to 
your communication service provider, the protocol used is that which is enabled by your provider (UDP, TCP or TLS).

Receivers of your media content (the persons you are communicating with) may also have the information you sent or they receive (for example text messages or audio/video recordings of calls, call logs) 
also stored locally on their computer by the app. 

When using app specific actions like accessing the contact list menu for example or attaching a photo/document for the purpose of sending it,
the app may thus access and temporary store locally said information. The app also accesses and temporary stores audio and video packets when making calls for the purpose of transmitting these 
to the communication service provider you are using.

Your personal data is transmitted over the internet using the protocol of your service provider (UDP/TCP/TLS) and is stored on their servers, they warrant the security of your information,
the application itself only stores this information locally (while installed) in order to send it to your chosen communications service provider.

The application does not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information or all type of content that you may upload/send using the application (e.g: text conversations, calls, videos, photos; etc).
